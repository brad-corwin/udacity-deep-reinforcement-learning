# Project 2 Report

## Learning Algorithm
This project uses the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to train an agent. DDPG utilizes an Actor and Critic network. The critic is used to approximate the maximizer and not as a learned baseline. The actor learns the best action.

The critic evaluates the optimal action-value function using the actor's best believed action.

## Ideas for Future Work
Get this implementation to work on the 20 agent environment.
